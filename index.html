    <h1>My Resume</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Hi There! My name is Sarah and I am currently self teaching to become a full stack web developer.</p>
    <p>At present, I am working in a hotel environment as a Revenue & Reservations Manager. Along the way I have encountered many lmitations as to what your host can provide to you from an interactive perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
    I developed a passion for coding a few years back however I had only tended to it on and off as I did not have a desired end goal.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now I know my passion is with coding and also the hospitality industry.
    <br>
    My goal is combine the two and to develop a more user friendly and enjoyable customer experience including that wow factor on the customer journey to try enhance conversion.
    </p>
<p>
    I am hoping that my knowledge from the inside as opposed to developing a hotel website from the outside will create a site that customers and staff are looking for.
    <br>
    From this I hope to create a successful website, learn each pro and con as I go along - and hopefully in the long run create a sucessful portfolio of multiple hotel properties.
    </p>
